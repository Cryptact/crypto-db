# crypto-db

This is a database of all cryptocurrencies.
It consists of a file which lists all cryptocurrencies with unique identifiers, together with symbol mapping tables in various namespaces such as cryptocurrency projects and exchanges.

## File structure

- `crypto-db.json` - where cryptocurrencies are defined
    - `id` - CryptoID, a unique identifier for each cryptocurrency.
    - `symbol` - widely-used ticker symbol of this cryptocurrency. Unique in this file. Can be changed later. If there multiple cryptocurrencies using the same symbol in different namespaces, the symbol in this file might be different from those in the namespaces to avoid ambiguity. Also, if the currency saw a branding change while keeping the underlying blockchain or token intact, this symbol might reflect the new brand. 
    - `name` - name of the cryptocurrency. Can be changed later.

- `crypto-actions.json` - records cryptocurrency events related to its brand, blockchain or token. Crypto Action is analogous to [Corporate Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_action) in traditional assets.
   - `id` - CryptoID in issue.
   - `sequence` - Sequence Number of this Crypto Action of this symbol, starting from 1. A pair of (`id`, `sequence`) can uniquely identify a Crypto Action.
   - `action` - description of the change
   - `reported` - UTC in ISO8601 when this action was first announced or reported.
   - `executed` -  UTC in ISO8601 when this action is executed or planned to execute.

- `map-for-<accuracy|coverage>/<namespace>.json` - defines a map between a symbol in a namespace to id. See 'About map-for-accuracy and map-for-coverage' below for detail.
- 
   - `ns_id` - identifier in the namespace.
   - `id` - corresponding CryptoID.
   - `from` - (optional) UTC in ISO8601 specifying when this mapping is enabled. Inclusive.
   - `to` - (optional) UTC in ISO8601 specifying when this mapping is disabled. Exclusive.
   - `ns_[key]` - (varies) additional, arbitrary information about `ns_id`, such as the name of the cryptocurrency in the namespace.

- `composite/<namespace>.json` - define a mapping from one `ns_id` to multiple CryptoIDs when the namespace consider multiple CryptoIDs as one cryptocurency. This is often used to chart prices continuously before and after crypto-actions.

### About CryptoID
CryptoID is used to uniquely identify a cryptocurrency and represents one blockchain or a token on a blockchain such as ERC20 Token on Ethereum.

CryptoID consists of 12 characters starting with "C", followed by 11 characters each of which is randomly picked from "TNLDPHGFYWKVXZJQ" without repetition. The letters were chosen to try as much to make CryptoID langauge-safe while enabling simultaneous, multiple PRs without conflicting with each other. They are alphabet characters, excluding the 5 frequently-used letters as well as vowels in English, as well as 3 common letters used in cryptocurrency symbols.

### About map-for-accuracy and map-for-coverage
Both files define a map from cryptocurrency identifiers in a certain namespace to CryptoIDs.

If your priority is to have an accurate mapping, use `map-for-accuracy`. If your priority is to map as many symbols as possible, use `map-for-coverage`.

`map-for-accuracy` tries to define all identifiers in the namespace. If a namespace comes up with a new symbol, and if the symbol isn't in this map, you can assume the CryptoID of the symbol is not defined yet.

`map-for-coverage` also defines a map from a namespace's identifier to CryptoID, as difference from symbols defined in `crypto-db.json`. If a namespace comes up with a new symbol, and if the symbol is not in this coverage map but found in `crypto-db.json` instead, then you can assume the namespace's symbol is the same as the one in `crypto-db.json` and obtain its CryptoID.
